Learning Java
=============

The first thing you have to do is walk though the basic features of the language , along with some examples ,
the best tutorial web series for this kind of thing is [thenewboston's tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFE2CE09D83EE3E28)

After going through these basic tutorials and watching the intermediate one's too , you should be familiar enough with
the language , it's coding style , features and IDE. The IDE I reccomend to use is IntelliJ community edition (free).

Something to keep in mind is that many tutorials out there are a little bit outdated because the language updates
every now and then, thus you should keep an eye on the changelogs at Oracle's website.

After completing all these steps you should choose something to practise on: Maybe an Applet game on the browser , maybe
a buffer overflow attack , maybe a GUI for a command line tool , maybe a whole website , maybe mod a game (like minecraft).

After finishing your first serious enough project , you are on your own . This is the point where true knowledge begins:
ask and reqad questions on stackoverflow , quora , chat with developers at gitter , join your local java user group , 
attend meetups , Java conferences , read books.

TIP: Focus on one thing/part of the language at a time.(e.g. You may want to focus on a specific library , or sector like 
the gaming industry)
